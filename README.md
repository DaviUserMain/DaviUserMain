I'm a Systems Analysis and Development student with a passion for Information Security. My journey began with curiosity about the inner workings of systems and software, which led me to deepen my knowledge of defensive and offensive cybersecurity.

I have a special interest in Malware Analysis, seeking to understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures of artifacts such as ransomware, RATs, and spyware. I believe that understanding adversary tools is the most effective way to create robust defenses. I also dedicate my studies to OSINT and Red Teaming.
